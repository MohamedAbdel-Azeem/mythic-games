# Mythic Games

Mythic Games is a web application developed as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). It's a platform where users can browse and add video games to their cart. The application fetches data from the [RAWG Video Game Database API](https://api.rawg.io/docs/).

## Technologies Used

- [React](https://reactjs.org/): A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/): A Predictable State Container for JS Apps.
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/): Declarative routing for React.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): An open-source language which builds on JavaScript by adding static type definitions.
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/): A build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
- [Material-UI](https://mui.com/): A popular React UI framework.

## Features

- Browse video games: Users can browse video games fetched from the RAWG API.
- Game details: Users can view detailed information about a game by clicking on it.
- Add to cart: Users can add games to their cart.
- Pagination: Users can navigate through different pages of games.

## Learning Outcomes

This project helped me to understand and implement various concepts like:

- Fetching data from an API and handling API responses using custom hooks.
- Managing application state using Redux.
- Routing in React applications using React Router.
- Styling components using Tailwind CSS and Material-UI.
- Writing modular and reusable React components.
